Quinoa
======

_Adaptive computational fluid dynamics_

<img src="quinoa.svg" align="right" width="25%" background=transparent>
Quinoa is a set of computational tools that enables research and numerical analysis in fluid dynamics. At this time it is a test-bed to experiment with various algorithms using fully asynchronous runtime systems.

Organization
============

Quinoa consists of the following tools:

  - [inciter](http://quinoacomputing.github.io/inciter_doc.html) - Partial differential equations solver on 3D unstructured grids
  - [walker](http://quinoacomputing.github.io/walker_doc.html) - Random walker for stochastic differential equations
  - [rngtest](http://quinoacomputing.github.io/rngtest_doc.html) - Random number generator test suite
  - [unittest](http://quinoacomputing.github.io/unittest_doc.html) - Unit test suite
  - [meshconv](http://quinoacomputing.github.io/meshconv_doc.html) - Mesh file converter

Build
=====

- Install prerequisites: _Debian/Ubuntu linux_ (line 1: required, line 2: recommended)

       apt-get install cmake gfortran gcc g++ openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev
       apt-get install gmsh libpugixml-dev libpstreams-dev libboost-all-dev liblapack-dev liblapacke-dev libhdf5-dev libhdf5-openmpi-dev libhypre-dev

- Install prerequisites: _Mac OS X_ (line 1: required, line 2: recommended)

       port install cmake openmpi-clang38 && port select clang mp-clang-3.8 && port select mpi openmpi-clang38-fortran
       port install gmsh pugixml lapack boost

- Clone, build third-party libraries, build & test

       git clone --recursive https://github.com/quinoacomputing/quinoa.git; cd quinoa
       mkdir tpl/build; cd tpl/build; cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=mpif90 ..; make; cd -
       mkdir build; cd build; cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc ../src; make; ../script/run_tests.sh

All executables will be under `build/Main/`.
