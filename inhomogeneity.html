<div class="textblock"><p>The implementation of spatial inhomogeneity can be approached using different strategies, two of which for particle codes are</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>3D-mesh-based, i.e., particle-in-cell-like (PIC) strategy, or</li>
<li>Point-cloud-based, i.e., smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics-like (SPH) strategy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many variants exists of each, especially, considering various parallelization and optimization strategies, as well as code simplicity, usability, applicability, and maintenance issues. Either approach contains a large uncertainty since each requires significant research. What follows is a collection of thoughts, e.g., pros and cons, of different strategies derived from the above approaches. Either or both PIC-, and SPH-based approaches can and may be implemented, since depending on the problem different algorithms may be optimal. Thus what follows serves as a documentation which is not a basis of making a decision.</p>
<h2>Advantages of a PIC-based strategy </h2>
<ul>
<li>Can use all knowledge on mesh-based algorithms, e.g.,<ul>
<li>The 3D domain is already well-defined by the incoming mesh (i.e., existing mesh generators take care of fine and coarse areas</li>
<li>Can use adaptive mesh refinement, etc.</li>
<li>Can develop (and leverage existing) hybrid algorithms (e.g., PDF, plasma) that solve some quantities on the mesh, some others with particles</li>
<li>Can use existing Eulerian-mesh-only algorithms for laminar (or turbulent) flows as the mesh-based part</li>
<li>Can leverage well-developed existing shock hydrodynamics algorithms for the Eulerian-mesh based part</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Easier to generate particles into cells that prescribe fine and coarse areas of the domain (task is outsourced to mesh generators)</li>
<li>Have some experience with it (at least in 2D), would not really have to start from scratch</li>
<li>Less risky, would certainly work (at least for incompressible flow)</li>
<li>Would potentially be easier to sell (e.g., in a proposal)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disadvantages of a PIC-based strategy </h2>
<ul>
<li>Potentially more complex code and algorithm: need mesh-, as well as particle-algorithms &ndash; more maintenance, potentially less suitable for future architectures</li>
<li>Requires a good mesh generator; generation is still a potentially expensive and complex operation</li>
<li>Requires a mesh: loading, partitioning, and in general, dealing with a 3D mesh in parallel is a highly non-trivial task &ndash; lots of time spend on non-novel issues, not yielding publications</li>
<li>Need for large-scale linear algebra, expensive and hard-to-parallelize iterative solvers and preconditioners</li>
<li>Need for monstrous linear algebra packages like PETSc or Trilinos</li>
<li>Meshes with particles need special strategies and algorithms for empty cells</li>
<li>Needs particle tracking (i.e., which cell is a given particle in?)</li>
<li>People will inevitably compare to what they are familiar with if they see a mesh, deeming a PIC-based particle method too expensive with a roughly 500 particles per cell requirement. This is especially if the cost of solving the pressure Poisson equation is 2%, as they compare apples and oranges when comparing computing a single realization on a grid (with an Eulerian method) and the full PDF (with a particle method)</li>
<li>Might potentially be harder to sell (in a proposal) due to the "PIC, yeah, been there, done that, got the T-shirt (i.e., a new PIC method method after 60-70 years, never really worked, will not work this time either"-like ideas from the know-it-alls</li>
<li>Less innovative</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages of a SPH-based strategy </h2>
<ul>
<li>Potentially simpler code and algorithm: only need particle-algorithms &ndash; shorter code, less maintenance, potentially more suitable for future architectures</li>
<li>Can potentially leverage progress in computer graphics and geometry (i.e., robotics, movies, etc.)</li>
<li>Can potentially leverage physics hardware developed for games, e.g., PhysX</li>
<li>Requires only a boundary mesh from user (and optionally a description of fine and coarse areas descriptions)</li>
<li>Requires no mesh or mesh generator</li>
<li>Requires potentially less memory (as no mesh is required)</li>
<li>No need to deal with a mesh, no complex IO, no partitioning, no need for AMR</li>
<li>No need for large-scale linear algebra, expensive and hard-to-parallelize iterative solvers and preconditioners</li>
<li>No need for monstrous linear algebra packages like PETSc or Trilinos</li>
<li>Easier to show that the method is fundamentally different than mesh-based ones</li>
<li>Less explored, possibly more potential for research and publications</li>
<li>There is no mesh in real life</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disadvantages of a SPH-based strategy </h2>
<ul>
<li>The details of the 3D domain (i.e., coarse and fine areas, boundary-layers) need detailed definition in code</li>
<li>Harder to generate particles with prescribed fine and coarse areas (task is not outsourced to mesh generators)</li>
<li>Need a consistent, stable, and conservative numerical method (these issues are less well-researched for particle methods)</li>
<li>Can only leverage on a body of knowledge that is smaller than for mesh-based methods: SPH, mesh-free methods, etc.</li>
<li>Problems only pertinent to particle methods need to be dealt with, e.g., tension instability</li>
</ul>
